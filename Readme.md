# TripleX Game

This project is my very first project in C++. While much of this game was built following a tutorial, I made some enhancements and improvements of my own!


 This is a relatively simple game where you must correctly guess three numbers. You will be provided the sum and the product of the numbers.

Be careful! Guess incorrectly too many times and you will set off the alarms! 

## Win condition:
Successfully reach level 10 without setting off any alarms

## Difficulty Levels: 

#### Very Easy
You have an unlimited number of guesses

#### Easy
The alert level will reset at each level. 3 incorrect guesses will set off the alarm

#### Medium 
The alert level will drop by 1 for each level successfully cleared. Reaching alert level 3 will set off the alarm!

#### Hard 
The alert level will not reset between levels. Reaching alert level 3 will set off the alarm!

#### Very Hard 
Any incorrect guess will set off the alarm!
