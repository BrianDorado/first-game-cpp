# TripleX Game

This project is my very first project in C++. While much of this game was built following a tutorial, I made some enhancements and improvements of my own!


 This is a relatively simple game where you must correctly guess three numbers. You will be provided the sum and the product of the numbers.

Be careful! Guess incorrectly too many times and you will set off the alarms! 

## Win condition:
Successfully reach level 10 without setting off any alarms
